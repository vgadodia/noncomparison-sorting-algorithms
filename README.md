# Noncomparison Based Sorting Algorithms
Five algorithms that sort different data using non-comparison based sorting methods such as Counting Sort and Radix Sort.

The sorting algorithms each require an input file to read data from and an output file to print the results. Therefore, you must create the input file prior to running the algorthims. In order to do so, follow the instructions at the beginning of the python files. (Each algorithm requires a specific format for the input file so be sure to use the python file corresponding to the sorting algorithm you wish to run)

Once you have created the input file for the algorithm you wish to run, follow the instructions at the beginning of the sorting algorithm file and you'll be all set!
